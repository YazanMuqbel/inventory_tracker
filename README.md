Inventory Tracker
As part of the web development cohort with AXSOS Academy, I wanted to demonstrate my learnings in the past few months.
I wanted to create a simple application that helps people who sell online track their inventory. I’m planning to keep adding to this app as my web development skills grow.
Functionalities and Features
•	Users can create accounts and login to the app.
•	Once logged in, users can create new products, and later be able to edit or delete them.
•	Each product has these data entries: title, description, cost, sale price and quantity.
•	Passwords are hashed. There’s also an email/password validation process.

Tech Stack
This project was built using Django framework, and uses HTML, CSS and some simple Javascript technologies.
